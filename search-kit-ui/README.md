# Search UI
Search UI is built on top of [searchkit](https://github.com/searchkit/searchkit) which allows to create beautiful search applications using declarative components. It visualizes the search api and provides end users a explicit way to understand search results (like why certain results show up and why results are ordered in such way). Base project is forked from [searchkit-boilerplate](https://github.com/searchkit/searchkit-boilerplate).

## How to use?
1. Enter search text in search bar.
2. Hover over the result to see explanation.
